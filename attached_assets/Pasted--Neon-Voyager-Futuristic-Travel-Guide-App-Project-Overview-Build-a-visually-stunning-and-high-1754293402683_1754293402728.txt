ðŸ”® Neon Voyager - Futuristic Travel Guide App
ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Build a visually stunning and highly interactive web application that serves as a travel guide for the modern era. The app will feature a complete neon-patterned user interface, a dark theme with vibrant accents, and advanced functionalities for exploring destinations. The project will showcase your skills in creating immersive UI/UX with modern web technologies.

ðŸ“‹ Core Features Required
Futuristic Dashboard: A dynamic home screen that greets the user with a stylized welcome message and showcases trending destinations with a glowing, animated card-based layout.

Destination Search: A prominent search bar with a neon glow effect. As the user types, a dropdown with live suggestions should appear.

Destination Detail Page:

A hero section with a high-quality background image of the destination.

Glowing title text and a brief summary of the location.

Tabs or a navigation system for "Hotels," "Restaurants," "Attractions," and "Weather."

Recommendations & Suggestions:

Hotels: A list of hotel suggestions with ratings, prices, and a link to an external booking site (can be a placeholder). Each hotel card should have a neon-bordered frame.

Restaurants: A list of recommended restaurants with cuisine type, price range, and a brief description.

Attractions: A list of key points of interest, complete with images and a short description.

Weather Widget: A sleek, animated widget displaying the current weather for the selected destination with neon-style icons.

âœ¨ Advanced & 'Vibr' Features
Interactive Map: Integrate a map service like Mapbox GL JS or Leaflet.js. The map should have a custom dark theme and use neon-colored markers for hotels, restaurants, and attractions.

Itinerary Builder: A dedicated section where users can add recommended spots to a personalized itinerary. This feature should have a drag-and-drop interface and allow for saving the plan to local storage.

Visualizer & Animations:

Use Vanta.js to create an animated, futuristic background on the home page (e.g., a "galaxy" or "net" effect).

Implement micro-interactions on all buttons and cards, such as a subtle zoom or glowing border on hover.

Use a library like Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and entrance animations for elements.

Thematic Soundscape: Add a subtle, ambient synth-wave or lo-fi soundtrack that plays in the background, which the user can toggle on or off.
